## Overview
Charro Negro is an innovative social robot project inspired by the legendary Mexican folk character "El Charro Negro". This project represents a unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern technology, designed to create meaningful interactions during Day of the Dead celebrations at science outreach events.

## Project Description
The development integrates cutting-edge technologies and traditional cultural elements:
- Advanced 3D printing for physical construction
- Artificial Intelligence for Natural Language Processing
- Contextual conversation capabilities
- Adaptive movement systems
- Text to Speach

## Research Impact
This project demonstrates the successful integration of robotics with cultural elements, creating meaningful human-robot interactions while preserving cultural heritage. A research paper about this project is currently in the process of being published in Orama Journal.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Explore innovative ways to preserve cultural heritage through technology
- Create engaging educational experiences
- Demonstrate the potential of social robotics in cultural contexts
- Bridge traditional storytelling with modern technology

## Technical Implementation
The project was developed using an evolutionary prototyping model, ensuring continuous improvement and refinement of both the physical design and interactive capabilities.

## Future Development
We continue to work on:
- Enhanced interaction capabilities
- Expanded cultural knowledge base
- Improved movement systems
